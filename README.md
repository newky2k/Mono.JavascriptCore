Mono.JavascriptCore
======================

Javascriptcore for Xamarin.iOS to provide access to the JSContext within a UIWebView instance.

This will allow for improved interaction between web applications and native components in a Hybri environment as it means the web app won't have to use the window.location approach.

This is currently at an early stage and Xamarin.iOS doesn't currently support JSExport which makes things a bit tougher.
